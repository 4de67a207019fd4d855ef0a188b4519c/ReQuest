# ReQuest
ReQuest aims to establish a reputationally secured marketplace of escrow oracles to mediate the creation of bounties for the sourcing of digital goods and information. The tooling uses a combination of Bitcoin bounties secured by a group of escrow oracles, Nostr as a communication medium to coordinate the creation of and arbitration of bounty fulfillment, and the public nature of both of these things to allow for a socially driven reputation system to be bootstrapped. 

By taking advantage of the cryptographic integrity guarantees and public nature of both Bitcoin and Nostr, ReQuest offers a platform for financially incentivizing the production or discovery of hard to find and valuable information in a way that aligns the incentives of all parties involved.
